# Timm Bits

A collection of reusable components and lightweight abstractions for training and evaluating NN.

This is an early WIP with the primary goal to get up and running on TPUs first. Expect significant changes, rewrites, additions...

The current train.py and validate.py scipts are evolving to use the timm.bits components, they will also change significantly.
